          <strong>Hello</strong>, my name is Andrew P. Malkin and this is my Portfolio Page.  In this section I will be giving a brief overview of my life including my early life, college, coding experience and hobbies.  I've created this website for two main reasons:
          <ol class="my-list">
            <li>To practice building a site using HTML and CSS.</li>
            <li>And so that I might share information about myself with others.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Let's get to it!</p>
        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <p>
          I was born in Los Angeles, California but before I was even in grade school my family moved to Ojai, California. Ojai is about 60mi north of Los Angeles situated between Santa Barbara and Ventura.  There I would attened Mira Monte Elementary School and later Villanova Prep. High School.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even at a young age I have always been interested in computers, and if someone were to have asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up my response would have been Mathematician.  After attending Villanova I was accepted at Reed College to study in their mathematics department
        </p>
        <h3>College</h3>
        <p>
          At Reed College I found out what it truly means to be a student of math. Over the course of my 5 years at Reed I would end up taking more than 15 math classes ranging from Single-Variable Calculus to Real Analysis. I was even able to take a few Computer Science classes including Intro to Programming and Algorithms and Data Structures.
        </p>
        <p>
          This definitely fueled my passion in Computer Science and ultimately led to me signing up for Epicodus--a coding bootcamp in Portland, Oregon--on Aug. 1st, 2016.
        </p>
        <h3>Coding Experience</h3>
        <p>
          I first started programing in Visual Basic when I was still in middle school.  My friend and I started making AOL progs for all sorts of things.  I remember making a 'fader' for AOL which allowed the user to choose color options for the instant messenger and, as the name suggests, even allowed one to fade from color to color.
        </p>
        <p>
          After VB6 I continued to play around with code here and there.  Once I got to Reed however I started doing a lot more coding in Java and Python.  Also at Reed I learned to code in Haskell.  Haskell from me was great seeing as I was coming from a math background and the concepts of coding in a purely functional language really rang true to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then I have coded an Android app and an iPhone app.  THe first app I did with a friend and it allowed Android users to better customize their experience with features like automatically toggling your wifi if you left the house.  The iPhone app that I wrote I did on my own and it was a golf app allowing the user to keep stats on their game as they played.  Both apps were pretty basic but it gave me a sense of what it takes to work on complete projects.
        </p>
        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>
          My biggest hobbies are:
          <ul>
            <li>Golfing</li>
            <li>Coding</li>
            <li>Math</li>
            <li>Surfing</li>
            <li>Watching Movies</li>
          </ul>
